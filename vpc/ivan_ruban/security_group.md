# VPC Security

## Security Group
---
### A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.

#### The following are the basic characteristics of security groups for your VPC:

- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

- You can specify separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic.

- When you create a security group, it has no inbound rules. Therefore, no inbound traffic originating from another host to your instance is allowed until you add inbound rules to the security group.

- By default, a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic. You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that allow specific outbound traffic only. If your security group has no outbound rules, no outbound traffic originating from your instance is allowed.

- **Security groups are stateful** â€” if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound security group rules. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.

- Instances associated with a security group can't talk to each other unless you add rules allowing the traffic (exception: the default security group has these rules by default).

Security groups are associated with network interfaces. After you launch an instance, you can change the security groups that are associated with the instance, which changes the security groups associated with the primary network interface (eth0). You can also specify or change the security groups associated with any other network interface. By default, when you create a network interface, it's associated with the default security group for the VPC, unless you specify a different security group. For more information about network interfaces, see Elastic Network Interfaces.
