# Users

`I AM user` - is the one who have some access to your AWS account. You can attach policy to user during creation or later.

To add policy to user:
> `Services -> IAM -> Users (Left menu) -> Choose user -> Add permissions`

One more feature in this part is `permissions boundary`. The permission boundary dominates over common permissions, it restricts access even if common permission allowing some actions with some resources.
