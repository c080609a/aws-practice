# Access Keys

`Access keys` are needed to perform actions via `CLI`. It can be generated for IAM user. It consists from the public part - `ID`, and the secret part - `secret key`.

To create keys:
> `Services -> IAM -> Users (Left menu) -> Choose user -> Security credentials tab -> Create access key`

The secret key will be shown only `once`, so you have to save it in some way.
